A backdoor written in Go

# Why?

Well, my Grandpa called me the other day and he's yellin' and cursin' cause the goddamn m&^#^%@^king computer restart cause some Flash program updated (and what the @&!&@^$!IU@% is Flash anyways??!) and now all of his Internet Explorer favourites are gone (my Grandma pipes up: "and you know, he's got all those word games he loves to play saved in his favourites").  

So I decided, hey, I'll write a backdoor this Friday night so that I can figure out where his favourites went.
